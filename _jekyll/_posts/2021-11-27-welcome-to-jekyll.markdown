hey there! i finally figured out jekyll enough to add a blog to my existing site. next step is to get it themed like my site, whenever i can get around to that. maybe even play around with the layout a little

as for the site itself, it's coming along! been working on it for most of the day so far. still trying to figure out how to size the whole site, especially trying to make it look good on both mobile and desktop. and i still need to add actual content to many of the pages. the "about me" page is pretty bare so far.

i've also been working on the photos page. the layout is mostly correct for the current size of the site, though i'm probably gonna need to tweak it once i get scaling done right for the whole site's layout. images are now scaled-down to fit the viewing size better, use less data, and improve page load times. i'll be trying to link them to the higher res images on clickthrough soon.
